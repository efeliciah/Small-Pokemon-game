 The request to add 4 more types of Pokemons required me too add them to the enum "Type" declaration in the Pokemon class.

 After that I also needed to add them to already existing methods "strongAgainst" and "weakAgainst", also in the pokemon class.
 "StrongAgainst" and "WeakAgainst" is used to determine the damage-multiplier for the attack-damage. I started with
 adding weaknesses and strengths to already existing types, according to the chart in the assignment.
 After that the program works for the old types attacking the new types. I also needed to add the new types as
 attackers and their strengths and weaknesses. I did that by copy-pasting the code for one of the old types and then
 just changing the types around to match the chart provided.

 The rest of the code ignores the pokemons type, and thus needed no change. The changes I needed to do to the code was
 small and done quickly, which is very nice for development of a program.
